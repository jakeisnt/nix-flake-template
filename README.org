#+TITLE: Nix Flake Project Template

A basic template for starting projects.
Make sure you have `direnv`, `nix` and `nix-flakes` installed and configured.

Place dependencies you'd like to have available in the `buildInputs` array of the `devShell`, then run `direnv allow` while in the directory and you'll be ready to go!
