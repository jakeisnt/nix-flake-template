#+TITLE: Nix Flake Project Template

This is a basic template for starting projects. It provides a basic framework for building a package and exposing its development environment, meant to be used with direnv and nix flakes. If you aren't comfortable with direnv, please use the nix develop command.

To add packages, add them to the array following "with pkgs;" in `default.nix`. `default.nix` should eventually be used to build the entire project, but it's best to start by using it just to power a development shell.

Please feel free to open issues and/or send me suggestions for improvement - when it comes to flakes, I'm still a relative beginner!
